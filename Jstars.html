 <p class="Jimmy" style="color.green">
 The text of this tag should hopefully be green because the text style is set to green. The background for this text should be tomato colored because that is the color I selected. The text should be aligned to the center because of the defined style text-align:center.
 </p>
 <p name= "James" style="color:red">
 The background for this text should be orange because I used background:Orange within the header. However the text should be red because I defined the style up above to be red. This tag's color and background is separated from the rest because it has it's style defined for it as single instead of a whole. 
 </p>
 <p id= "Jordan">
 The text for this statement should be Blue because it is what I labelled it as in the header up above. This tag will not be affected by the singled out styles defined for the statements above because they are meant only for that sentence.
 <h1 name= "James">
 This tags background should be Orange because that is what James's background is defined as up above. This tag's text size will also appear bigger because it has a header tag. This has a defined style up above a yellow so it should appear as yellow. It's attached within the body so therefore this should be the color.
