<p style=color:Red;>There is nothing in the world like getting your program to run and run correctly. Of course, if it runs perfectly the first time, I tend to be more suspicious. That never happens, so if it appears to work, I might ask why. In most cases, however, my code runs after a long fight to get it working and when it finally does… well, I feel pretty good about myself.</p>
<p>Second Paragraph.</p>
<p style=color:Blue;><i>Computers are little minions of Satan. They are silicon-based evil temptresses that believe I will always come back. They believe that I am held enraptured by the seducing call of free automation, quicker download times, and nearly limitless power. “Come,” they say, “come and be a god among men as you create a mighty universe that only you control. Come and we will give you power.” The sad thing is, they are completely right.</i></p>
