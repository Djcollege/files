  <p>Hey there, my name is Derrek Williams and I am very happy to be working with you all. I am from Huntsville, Alabama.
  Huntsville is a decent sized city and I had a lot of fun growing up there. I go to Rappahannock Community College 
  and I intend on transferring to Old Dominion University after I get my associates. I am pursuing a computer science bachelor's degree
  in hopes of not only bettering myself with technology but to bring in a stable income for my future family as well as myself. </p>
